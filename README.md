# DFF Psychological Skill

## Description
This skill works more like an API to a knowladge base.

At the moment it supports two topics (flows):
- description of some classical psychological experiments. Each experiment description is devided into multiple segments like brief overview or more detailed explanation of how the experiment was conducted
- dictionary for a few psychological terms a user may encounter while communicating with the bot. Request to explain something does not break the previous flow and a user may go back to it if he/she wants.
